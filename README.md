# The instagram homework

## How it went

i felt like it was a good homework for the weekend, had the homework spread out between friday, saturday
and sunday, which meant i could have a rest between days where i felt i needed it. feeling refreshed made
it simpler to carry out the homework with a clearer and focussed head.


## what i found difficult to implement

i would have liked to have it perfect however sometimes that doesn't happen and i need to understand that i will only
get better in the future with practice. the hr bit was giving me a lot of problems, i found that the most difficult thing to implement, the links are all in place however something is stopping them from working and couldn't figure out what it was.

## what i am pleased with

the pros were that it went better than last time, using the grid system from bootstrap helped a lot, i think it looks more
accurate from how it went last week, so i am happy that i have definitely improved. i am pleased with the end result as the structure has perfected in comparison to last week.
